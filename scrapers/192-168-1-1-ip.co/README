# Instructions

Run scrape.py to generate an output file. It takes a long time to run.

Running massage.py will convert the data into the appropriate format. There may be parsing errros if values have changed substatially since this was run on Apr 19 2021.

data.js contains a js encoded list of objects scraped from this site

Copy this manually to the data directory for now. This is the wrong way to do it but in lieu of a database for now, it will work.
